A bag contains 4 white, 5 black and 7 red balls. From the bags, two balls are drawn at random. Calculate the probability that both the balls are white balls. 
Show that the surface area of a closed cuboid with a square base and given volume is minimum when it is a cube. 
Solve the system of equations using matrices: x+y-2z= -3, 2x-3y+5z=11, and 3x+2y-4z=-5.

Calculate the coordinate points where the line passes through the points (3,−4,−5) and (2,−3,1), crosses the plane determined by the points (1,2,3), (4,2,−3) and (0,4,3). 
A die is thrown twice and the sum of the numbers rising is noted to be 6. Calculate the is the conditional probability that the number 4 has arrived at least once? 
A stone is dropped into a quiet lake and waves move in the form of circles at a speed of 4 cm/sec. At the instant, when the radius of the circular wave is 10 cm, how fast is the enclosed area increasing? 
The sum of surface areas of a sphere and a cuboid with sides x/3,x and 2x, is constant. Show that the sum of their volumes is minimum if x is equal to three times the radius of the sphere. 
The probability of solving the specific problem independently by the persons’ A and B are 1/2 and 1/3 respectively. In case, if both the persons try to solve the problem independently, then calculate the probability that the problem is solved.
